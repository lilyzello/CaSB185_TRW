This repository contains different notebooks that we used to examine trends in drug overdose deaths by gender, race, and geography in the United States during the period 2018-2022.

Our code originates from article "Fentanyl-driven acceleration of racial, gender and geographical disparities in drug overdose deaths in the United States" which can be found at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10032521/.

All of our data is gathered from the CDC Wonder Database: https://wonder.cdc.gov/.
